    Components
    Compontnts are Functions which returns UI.
    Functions (Components) which we will write, used as tags in JSX to render.

    // When we write function name in lower case and export it.
    // But when import it and use as capitalized, it will work fine.
    // But when we change the name from import too. (lowercase).
    // Nothing will be rendered.
    
    When we have to add another component inside component, we can use {children}
    <ComponentName/> -> Single component
    <ComponentName> <AnotherComponent/>  </ComponentName> -> With Children Component
        In ComponentName() we have to use {children} where we want to use it.
    // We can pass default props value as well.
